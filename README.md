# Slideshow

This is a slideshow program that will create a slideshow of ten up to selected images for the user. 

My swing projects are still looking horrendous, but I'm liking how this one turned out.

I didn't want to spend too much time on this project since I wanted to finish this one fast and get started on the final project.

###Java II Project 3 Description:


Write an application that displays a slideshow of images, one after the other, with a time delay between each image. 
The user should be able to select up to 10 images for the slide show and specify the time delay in seconds.
